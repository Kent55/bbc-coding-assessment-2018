## BBC Coding Assessment 2018
This is my submission for my BBC coding assessment 2018. This is following the instructions from the [data-table-trainee-assessment](https://github.com/BBCVisualJournalism/data-table-trainee-assessment) repository.

As stated in the original instructions you will need a HTTP server in order to load the JSON file. 

**To test either download the source files or clone the repository with:**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Kent55/bbc-coding-assessment-2018.git
```

For this assessment I decided to use entirely pure JavaScript. My reason being to highlight my knowledge within the language itself and to make use of ES6 & ES7 features such as the `arrow function` and `async fetch await`.

For the visual representation of the data, which in my case I chose a bar graph, I made use of the [Highcharts API](https://www.highcharts.com).

JavaScript is located in `js/custom.js`
CSS is located in `css/main.css`
